## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

EQEmu Pack is a weekly mirror snapshot of https://github.com/akkadius/eqemu-maps and https://github.com/ProjectEQ/projecteqquests/ with each expansion filtered out.

This shrinks the download for initial installs if you only plan to use certain expansions.

It also includes version files so tools can look at them to check if their local files are up to date or not.
